TODO list:

Add pathfinding that may take into account closest points if actual destination cannot be reached
Add pathfinding that takes into account avoiding certain edges

toggle cave route lines on map
specific path distance area details has same colour as route colour

left handled vs right handed layout
icon buttons and text buttons aren't mixed they have separate areas

change yards to meters - add preferences option to change if required
hold gesture being up as long press buton, fix this

Cancel button in cancel route misleading

LL old survey remove class and store in JSON file

Make cave card more readable - fix font colours

Highlight last selected

have loading text when loading image on survey

make composables stateless

do validation for cave survey data input
difficulty none shows up on easy
validation for (must have nodes and edges)
move save logic out of UI thread, big images saving will crash app (if pixels per meter is big, then compress image)

maybe switch the order of creation i.e. enter cave details then do survey image uplaod and markup
